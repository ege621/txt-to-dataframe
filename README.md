# txt-to-dataframe
This code converts a messy txt file of product logs to a proper dataframe, allowing mathematical operations to be done and numpy to be used. 
After the dataframe is constructed, it plots the relevant sensor data. The column which the code will plot can be changed by following the comments in the plot.py file.
